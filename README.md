# Mastermind

This Python program implements the game of Mastermind. The objective of the game is to guess the exact positions of the numbers that are randomized.

## How to Play

1. Enter the desired number of colors, positions, and whether duplicates are allowed when prompted.
2. The program generates a random secret code based on your inputs.
3. Start guessing the secret code by entering your guesses when prompted.
4. Receive feedback in the form of hints after each guess:
   - `*` indicates a correct number and position.
   - `o` indicates a correct number but in the wrong position.
5. Continue guessing until you solve the code.
